# Master Thesis:  
**Guiding the Latent Space of Generative Models Based on Subjective Human Factors**

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for my on going master’s thesis titled **"Guiding the Latent Space of Generative Models Based on Subjective Human Factors"**. The project explores how human input, particularly subjective factors such as usability and design preferences, can guide the latent space of generative AI models, improving their outputs for real-world applications. 

This work is conducted in collaboration with the Design Computation and Digital Engineering (DeCoDE) Lab in the Mechanical Engineering department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Specifically, it builds upon the research conducted by:

Regenwetter, Lyle, Brent Curry, and Faez Ahmed. “BIKED: A Dataset and Machine Learning Benchmarks for Data-Driven Bicycle Design.” In Proceedings of the International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC-21), virtual, 2021.
